## NExt distro i might use in new lap

----------

### new (soon ig)[winner fn : eos]

- eos
- Fedora
- WIndow (yuck for a month maybe)
    why not like i wanna learn it with xfce

### old [winner:void]

- opensuse (out- not now)
    couldnt figure out this man what is this

- vanila arch with i3wm only
  - pure arch works same too but i am confused with arch and void linux what should
     i use arch + i3wm  or void + i3wm
     okie now it seems arch is eazy when compared to void

- void
 - void seems different gonna try like runit what it does and how hard is it
    pros (very light weight and nothing ships with it i lit mean nothing )
    cons (Hard !! to install or skill issue)
    de (gonna try like i3wm or sway whatever i feel / mostly i3wm)

> [!NOTE]
> after intense thought i have decided to go for i3wm with pure arch and will later
>    switch to void (after : <if> i get my new lap)
